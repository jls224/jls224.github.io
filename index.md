## About Me

My name is Josh Simon and I am from Rockland County, New York. I attended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania where I graduated with a Bachelors of Science and Economics in Finance. While in college I took many opportunities to advance my professional skills and show my work ethic and drive to be involved. I was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity and an Interfraternity Council member, executive board member of the Pre-Law Society, and student panelist of the University Committee on Discipline. I also took this time to work in internships to prepare for a career in the legal field, including working at the Rockland County District Attorney's Office and at The Law Offices of Phillips and Millman. Today, I am a Litigation Paralegal at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in New York. For further information, contact me via email.

## About Me

My name is Josh Simon and I am from Rockland County, New York. I attended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania where I graduated with a Bachelors of Science and Economics in Finance. While in college I took many opportunities to advance my professional skills and show my work ethic and drive to be involved. I was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity and an Interfraternity Council member, executive board member of the Pre-Law Society, and student panelist of the University Committee on Discipline. I also took this time to work in internships to prepare for a career in the legal field, including working at the Rockland County District Attorney's Office and at The Law Offices of Phillips and Millman. Today, I am a Litigation Paralegal at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in New York. For further information, contact me via email.

## Hobbies

I love music, fitness, pop culture, photography, and cooking. A lot of these intertwine with each other, most commonly through my playlists being curated for different activities such as the gym or when I'm cooking. My top artists changes at least once a year, but I will always have a soft spot for classic rock because of my Dad with Queen and Motley Crue being my favorite bands. I also love modern artists like Cage the Elephant, but my favorite is BoyWithUke. Another one of my favorite ways of listening to music is choosing an artist that I recently started listening to, taking one of their albums, and listening to the whole thing while going on a nature walk. 

I grew up with Nintendo games and Marvel shows and while I do not have as much time these days to watch shows or play video games, I always find myself going back to them every so often to see what things are like now compared to when I was younger.

Photography is a new hobby of mine, mostly in the form of disposable film and polaroid photos. I have a portfolio of my favorite time-capsule pictures on instagram so that I can hold onto these memories in a way that feels more tangible compared to the pictures you can take on your phone. In fact, I included a few of my favorites on this website.
